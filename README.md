GcForest paper urlï¼š ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835 ).
The official release of the gcForest code used in Zhou and Feng 2017 [here](https://github.com/kingfengji/gcforest). 

This project implements a **multi-channel deep-forest** based on the pylablanche's [work](https://github.com/pylablanche/gcForest). Thus, the project allows you to input multi-channels images.
