## A implementation of gcForest (or named deep Forest)
## Introduction
GcForest paper urlï¼š ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835 ).
The official release of the gcForest code used in paper at [here](https://github.com/kingfengji/gcforest). 

This project implements a **multi-channel deep-forest** based on the pylablanche's [work](https://github.com/pylablanche/gcForest). Thus, the project allows you to input multi-channels images.
# Using GCForest
The project contains a small sample data set, so you can directly run *main.py* for training, and you can directly see the test results\n
'''
cd ./ \n
python main.py
